10/13/2025, 8:00:00 AM (UTC-8)`,answer:`Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk said on Oct. 14 on X that bitcoin is based on energy, contrasting it with fiat currencies that governments can inflate. His remark was in response to a Zerohedge post linking the rise in gold, silver, and bitcoin prices to currency debasement driven by government spending on the global artificial intelligence arms race. Zerohedge added that money can be printed but energy cannot. Musk agreed, writing: 'True. That is why bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.'

What did Elon Musk say about bitcoin and energy?
Elon Musk stated that Bitcoin is based on energy, emphasizing that while governments can print fiat currency, energy cannot be faked or created artificially.

Why did Elon Musk contrast bitcoin with fiat currencies?
Musk highlighted that fiat currencies are prone to inflation because governments can issue more of them, while bitcoin's foundation in energy gives it a more tangible and limited value base.

What was the context of Musk's comment about bitcoin?
His comment responded to a Zerohedge post suggesting that the rising prices of gold, silver, and bitcoin are linked to global government spending and currency debasement caused by the AI arms race.

What is the main takeaway from Musk's statement?
Musk's remark reinforces the idea that bitcoin's value is rooted in the real-world cost of energy, contrasting it with the easily manipulated nature of traditional fiat money.`},{id:"12",question:`Bitcoin Touches Record Price Above $125,000
10/4/2025, 8:00:00 AM (UTC-8)`,answer:`Bitcoin nabbed a new high.

The leading cryptocurrency overnight touched a record, reaching all-time highs around $125,400 to top the old high-water mark, around $124,480, set in August. (It more recently traded closer to $123,000.)

The latest moves have bitcoin's total market value at about $2.45 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap, and the total value of crypto at around $4.21 trillion. Bitcoin has had a dramatic year, climbing off prices below $80,000 seen in April.

While bitcoin bulls generally have seen the continued climb of the currency as inevitable, some have had more specific reasons for foreseeing more upside in late 2025. It has a history of posting new records in the 1,064-day window after bear-market lows, the last of which was on Nov. 21, 2022.

Meanwhile, bitcoin trading volumes on crypto exchanges have been rising since a September-end drawdown. Rising volumes have tended to be good for prices.

Some analysts see reasons to expect bitcoin to keep climbing. JPMorgan analysts in an Oct. 1 note suggested that the 'debasement trade'—in which both retail and institutional investors hedge their bets with gold and bitcoin—to pick up steam amid concerns ranging from heightened geopolitical uncertainty to enduringly high government debt across economies and waning U.S. dollar dominance.

More broadly, recent developments have suggested that the crypto industry is making continued progress as it seeks to claim more investor dollars and position in the world of finance—among them the launch of several new crypto ETFs and the rise in popularity of crypto treasury stocks.`},{id:"13",question:`Giant Trump statue holding Bitcoin displayed outside US Capitol to mark Fed rate decision
9/16/2025, 8:00:00 AM (UTC-8)`,answer:`WASHINGTON (7News) — A 12-foot golden statue of President Donald Trump holding a Bitcoin was installed outside the U.S. Capitol, coinciding with the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday.

At 2 p.m., the Fed announced that it reduced its key interest rate by a quarter-point, marking the first cut since Dec. 2024. The cut will lower the short-term rate to about 4.1% down from 4.3%. Last year, the central bank lowered rates three times due to concerns that job growth was slowing and unemployment was rising.

The central bank also revealed plans for two more rate cuts this year. However, only one is anticipated in 2026, which might disappoint Wall Street, as they had expected five cuts by next year.

The temporary piece, located on 3rd Street from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., was funded by a collective of cryptocurrency investors. Organizers said the piece is intended to provoke debate about the future of digital currency, monetary policy, and the federal government's role in financial markets.`}];return n.useEffect(()=>{const t=c.find(d=>d.id===a);t?(o(t.question),s(t.answer)):console.log("FAQ item not found, redirect needed")},[a]),e.jsxs("div",{className:"helpcenterdetail-container",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"header",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"nav-bar",children:[e.jsx(h,{to:"/support",className:"back-arrow",children:e.jsx("i",{className:"fas fa-arrow-left"})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"page-title",children:"Help Center"})]})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"content-card",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"helpcenterdetail-content",children:i&&e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"question-title",children:i}),e.jsx("div",{className:"divider-line"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"answer-content",children:r})]})})}),e.jsx("style",{children:`
